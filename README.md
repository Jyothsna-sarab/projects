# Machine Learning Projects â€“ Classification & Clustering Models

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. These projects demonstrate classification and clustering techniques applied to real-world datasets, particularly in healthcare and pattern recognition.

## Projects Included

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Tree

**Objective**:\
Develop a classification model to predict the risk of diabetes based on various health indicators.

**Dataset**:\
Features include glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin level, age, and more.

**Methodology**: - Data preprocessing: handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization - Feature selection based on correlation - Implemented Decision Tree Classifier - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix - Visualization of the decision tree for interpretability

**Outcome**:\
A decision tree model capable of classifying individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on health data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

**Objective**:\
Build a predictive model to estimate heart disease risk based on patient health metrics.

**Dataset**:\
Includes features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, max heart rate, and chest pain type.

**Methodology**: - Data cleaning and feature engineering - Trained Logistic Regression model - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score - Used visualizations to interpret model decisions and data distribution

**Outcome**:\
The model predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on their medical profile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Iris Dataset Clustering Using K-Means

**Objective**:\
Cluster iris flower species using unsupervised learning on sepal and petal dimensions.

**Dataset**:\
The Iris dataset containing sepal and petal length/width for three flower types.

**Methodology**: - Feature scaling and normalization - Applied K-Means clustering - Used PCA for 2D visualization - Evaluated clusters using silhouette score and Elbow Method

**Outcome**:\
Iris species were successfully grouped into clusters, revealing distinct patterns based on flower measurements.
